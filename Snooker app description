# Snooker app description

The app contains a number of different ImageButtons (a total of 14 ImageButtons for the 7 coloured balls of 
the game - 7 for each player, 4 undo/redo buttons (2 for each player), 2 +4_points buttons (1 for each player - this is valid in 
case of a foul) and a restart button.

Each button corresponding to a coloured ball, changes the score as follows:

1. a red ball increases the score by 1
2. a yellow ball increases the score by 2
3. a green ball increases the score by 3
4. a brown ball increases the score by 4
5. a blue ball increases the score by 5
6. a pink ball increases the score by 6
7. a black ball increases the score by 7

The undo button reverts the score to its previous value. This works only once!
The redo button reverts the score to its value before clicking the undo button. This works only once!

The two buttons that increase the score by 4 points are clicked in case of a foul.

The restart button displays who is the winner of the previous game and upon clicking it again, it clears the display area. The latter
is also cleared when any of the other buttons are clicked.
